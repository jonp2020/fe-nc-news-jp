# Front-end Northcoder News App

## About

A social-media news agregator built using React and styled with CSS and styled components.

A hosted version on Netlify can be found [here](https://nc-news-jonp2020.netlify.app/).

A back-end api hosted on Heroku can be found [here](https://nc-news-fe-jonp.herokuapp.com/). The code for this is on [Github](https://github.com/jonp2020/be-nc-news-jp)

Users of the app can read articles, sort them by topic and date and vote articles up or down. Users can also view comments from other users as well as add and delete their own comments.

In order to vote, add and / or delete comments, the user needs to login (currently set to a default user called jessjelly). Only comments add by this user may be deleted.
